                <div class="milestone">China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel
                    coronavirus was eventually identified.</div>
                <div class="date">1 Jan 2020</div>
                <div class="milestone">WHO had set up the IMST (Incident Management Support Team) across the three
                    levels of the organization: headquarters, regional headquarters and country level, putting the
                    organization on an emergency footing for dealing with the outbreak.</div>
                <div class="date">4 Jan 2020</div>
                <div class="milestone">WHO reported on social media that there was a cluster of pneumonia cases – with
                    no deaths – in Wuhan, Hubei province.</div>
                <div class="date">5 Jan 2020</div>
                <div class="milestone">WHO published our first Disease Outbreak News on the new virus. This is a
                    flagship technical publication to the scientific and public health community as well as global
                    media. It contained a risk assessment and advice, and reported on what China had told the
                    organization about the status of patients and the public health response on the cluster of pneumonia
                    cases in Wuhan.</div>
                <div class="date">10 Jan 2020</div>
                <div class="milestone">WHO issued a comprehensive package of technical guidance online with advice
                    to all countries on how to detect, test and manage potential cases, based on what was known about
                    the virus at the time. This guidance was shared with WHO's regional emergency directors to share
                    with WHO representatives in countries.<br /><br />
                    Based on experience with SARS and MERS and known modes of transmission of respiratory viruses,
                    infection and prevention control guidance were published to protect health workers recommending
                    droplet and contact precautions when caring for patients, and airborne precautions for aerosol
                    generating procedures conducted by health workers.</div>

                <div class="date">13 Jan 2020</div>
                <div class="milestone">Officials confirm a case of COVID-19 in Thailand, the first recorded case outside
                    of China.</div>
                <div class="date">14 Jan 2020</div>
                <div class="milestone">WHO's technical lead for the response noted in a press briefing there may have
                    been limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus (in the 41 confirmed cases), mainly
                    through family members, and that there was a risk of a possible wider outbreak. The lead also said
                    that human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given our experience with SARS, MERS and
                    other respiratory pathogens.</div>
                <div class="date">20-21 January 2020</div>
                <div class="milestone">WHO experts from its China and Western Pacific regional offices conducted a brief
                    field visit to Wuhan.</div>
                <div class="date">22 Jan 2020</div>
                <div class="milestone">WHO mission to China issued a statement saying that there was evidence of
                    human-to-human transmission in Wuhan but more investigation was needed to understand the full extent
                    of transmission.</div>
                <div class="date">22- 23 January 2020</div>
                <div class="milestone">The WHO Director- General convened an Emergency Committee (EC) under the
                    International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to assess whether the outbreak constituted a public
                    health emergency of international concern. The independent members from around the world could not
                    reach a consensus based on the evidence available at the time. They asked to be reconvened within 10
                    days after receiving more information.</div>
                <div class="date">28 Jan 2020</div>
                <div class="milestone">A senior WHO delegation led by the Director-General travelled to Beijing to
                    meet China’s leadership, learn more about China’s response, and to offer any technical
                    assistance.<br /><br />
                    While in Beijing, Dr. Tedros agreed with Chinese government leaders that an international team of
                    leading scientists would travel to China on a mission to better understand the context, the overall
                    response, and exchange information and experience.</div>
                <div class="date">30 Jan 2020</div>
                <div class="milestone">The WHO Director-General reconvened the Emergency Committee (EC). This was
                    earlier than the 10-day period and only two days after the first reports of limited human-to-human
                    transmission were reported outside China. This time, the EC reached consensus and advised the
                    Director-General that the outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
                    (PHEIC). The Director-General accepted the recommendation and declared the novel coronavirus
                    outbreak (2019-nCoV) a PHEIC. This is the 6th time WHO has declared a PHEIC since the International
                    Health Regulations (IHR) came into force in 2005.</div>

                    travelled to Wuhan and two other cities. They spoke with health officials, scientists and health
